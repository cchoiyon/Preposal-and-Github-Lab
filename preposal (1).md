# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Temple Dining  

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A app that helps students with dining on campus. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

First off, the app will open a menu that allows the user to choose a variaty of restuartants. the app allows for midfications that will be done by the user choosing it on the setttings part of the app. 
It will use if statements and while loops and also use data storage so the users modifications can be saved and not be lost. Each restuarnt that is on campus will be listed and the full details of the restuarnt will be on the app. These details will help the user search through what restuartns will be good or not for them. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The app main page will be done. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The functionality of the app.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The whole layout of the app will be done. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps will be to create the main page of the app. Research ways to create a functional home buttons and then use python refrences to look up how to create certain functions in the app. Bhaavika will most likely gather information while I gather information about how to create the other pages of the app. For now our main goal is to actully have the app to work the way we want it too. We would also look up a way to implement a API for the map system that we plan to use.
